	<h2>Our Story</h2>

	<section class="text_story">


		<div class="story"><p>The story of the world’s most famous bakery begins in 1991 on a quaint, cobblestone corner in the West Village where Pastry Emporium Bakery opened its doors for the first time –though under another name. The sweet smell of cakes and cookies and pies and pudding tumbled out, wafting down the streets, beckoning all in. <br/>

		Our red velvet cupcakes became iconic and people lined up around the block for our banana pudding. There was even talk of New York pretzel guys becoming cupcake guys. Pastry Emporium Bakery was a destination for locals and tourists alike. <br/>

		It was time for us to open the cupboards and share our magic with the world. Our neighborhood bakery found its way into new neighborhoods near and far, we wrote cookbooks and helped people all over celebrate their most important moments. <br/>

		And while we have grown, a few things will always remain: open early and close late, a dollop of buttercream makes everything better, and our mission: make today sweeter than yesterday. </p></div>

		<div class="chef_story"><p>Asia Bold, Award-winning Pastry Chef, has shaken up the pastry world with innovation and creativity at the heart of her work. Named the World’s Best Pastry Chef in 2017 by the World’s 50 Best Restaurants awards, one of Business Insider’s “Most Innovative People Under 40” and Crain’s “40 under 40,” Chef Asia has strived through her career to bring a refreshing approach to the world of desserts. In 2015, she was bestowed the prestigious l’Ordre du Mérite Agricole award for her accomplishments. Vanity Fair named her one of the “50 Most Influential French” and Daily Mail UK claimed her “the most fêted pastry chef in the world.”</br>
		For her prolific creativity, Food & Wine called her a “Culinary Van Gogh” while the New York Post coined her “the Willy Wonka of New York.” Today, her eponymous bakery in New York still welcomes lines averaging 100 guests prior to opening each morning.
		Prior to opening her first shop in NYC, Asia served as the Executive Pastry Chef for restaurant Daniel. During her six years at Daniel (the longest tenure of any pastry chef there), the restaurant earned its coveted third Michelin star and a four-star review from The New York Times.</p></div>
